### Description

- Goal: Produce a weather dashboard using a call to the weather api.
  This should include the current conditions (temperature, humidity,
  UV index, date, and icon). A color should be shown for the UV index to signify
  the currenct conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe. A representation of the past searches should also be enabled for a history feature. The current and
  future conditions for the search city should also be represented.

### Future Goals

- Overall, I would like to add the five day forecast elements of the
  assignment. I would also like to include more CSS and layout options, considering
  my current html. Additionally, I think I could make a lot more commits
  through the use of the VS code terminal feature.
